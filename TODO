- UI to register JDBC drives via GUI
- <script> should be able to ignore returning value when it is not expected.
- Retire explicit Variable wrapper. The expression ${x.toInt() < y.toInt()} should become ${x < y}
- Passing variables by reference or by value? (consider the case of passing mutable collections)
- Rework <database>. Use decent connection pool and clean all the resources properly.
- What about transactions support for <database>?
