- Retire explicit Variable wrapper. The expression ${x.toInt() < y.toInt()} should become ${x < y}
- Passing variables by reference or by value? (consider the case of passing mutable collections)
- What about transactions support for <database>?
- Function definition scope. What about overriding?
      f() {
        k() {}
        k() // this is OK
      }
      k() // Currently WH allows it, but this is weird.
          // The function k is neither in lexical nor in dynamic scope at this point, so it should NOT be accessible in any ways.

- <empty> should be more smart and not to allow the direct descendants to collect the returning data as it is gonna be ignored anyway.
